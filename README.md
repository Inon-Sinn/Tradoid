# Tradoid
#### instructions:
run `Server\database.py`.\
change the ip of root in `app\src\main\java\com\example\tradoid\backend\HttpUtils.java` to be that of the device the server is ran from.\
change the ip in `app\src\main\res\xml\network_security_config.xml` as well so android studio will not block it.
